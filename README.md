## Motivation

The lack of knowledge about herbal plants is a significant barrier to their effective use as natural remedies. By providing individuals with reliable and practical guidance on identifying and using herbal plants, we aim to empower users to harness their potential benefits. Our app will serve as a comprehensive resource to assist users in recognizing herbal plants and understanding their uses, ensuring safe and informed utilization for personal healthcare needs.

## Project Scope

The primary objective of this project is to develop a food classification system with the following features:
- Photo Scanning: Users can scan photos of herbal plants to get detailed information about their names, health benefits, and usage.
- Disease-Based Search: The app offers tailored herbal plant recommendations for natural treatments based on specific health conditions.
- Herbal Remedies Chatbot: Chatbot answers questions related to herbal remedies and how to utilize herbal plants

## Technology Stack

### Machine Learning
- Framework: TensorFlow
- Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), using a pre-trained MobileNet V2 model
- Programming Language: Python
- Development Environment: Google Colab

### Android Development
- Design Tool: Figma
- Programming Language: Kotlin
- Networking: Retrofit

### Cloud
- Cloud Provider: Google Cloud Platform
- Programming Language: NodeJS, Python
- Framework : express.js, flask
- Backend Support: Integrating backend services using Google Cloud Platform for data storage, processing and deployment
 

## Implementation

The implementation involves developing a system that captures images of food items, processes these images through the trained CNN model, and provides a recommendation on whether the food is suitable for pregnant women. The Android application will interface with the backend supported by Google Cloud to deliver real-time recommendations and updates.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements may include:
- Integration with E-Commerce: Adding herbal shopping features directly from the app, such as buying plant seeds or herbal products.
- Community Features: Create a community of users to share experiences, tips, and herbal recipes, as well as discuss the benefits of specific plants.
- Health Monitoring Features: Integrate features to record users' health conditions and recommend appropriate herbs.
